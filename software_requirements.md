# Software Requirements Specification: Real-time Scoreboard Application

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a real-time scoreboard application. The application retrieves initial game information and utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) for subsequent updates, providing users with a dynamic view of game progress.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The scoreboard application is a client-side application that interacts with a backend server to display game data in real-time.  It is designed to be responsive and efficient, providing a seamless user experience.

### 2.2 Product Functions

* **Fetch Initial Game Data:** Retrieve the initial state of the game from the server.
* **Real-time Updates:** Receive and display real-time game updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
* **User Interface:** Present game information in a clear and intuitive manner.
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle network errors and data inconsistencies.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

The application is intended for users who want to follow a game's progress in real time. No specific technical expertise is required.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

The application will operate on modern web browsers supporting Server-Sent Events.


## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 External Interface Requirements

* **User Interface:**
    * Display game information (e.g., score, time remaining, player stats).
    * Provide visual indicators for real-time updates.
    * Display errors and status messages to the user.
* **Server Interface:**
    * Utilize HTTP requests for initial game data retrieval.
    * Utilize Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates.
    * Handle potential network interruptions robustly.


### 3.2 Functional Requirements

* **FR1: Data Retrieval:** The application shall retrieve initial game data from the server upon loading.
* **FR2: Real-time Updates:** The application shall receive and display real-time game updates via SSE.
* **FR3: Data Presentation:** The application shall present the game data in a user-friendly format.
* **FR4: Error Handling:** The application shall gracefully handle network errors and server-side errors.  Errors should be clearly presented to the user.
* **FR5: User Interaction:** The application shall be responsive to user interaction (e.g., refreshing the data, changing display options).

### 3.3 Performance Requirements

* The application shall be responsive to updates with minimal delay.
* The application shall minimize unnecessary data transfers.

### 3.4 Logical Database Requirements

* No local database is required.  Data is ephemeral, held in memory and refreshed by SSE updates.


## 4. High-Level Design

The application will be structured as a single-page application (SPA) with JavaScript handling the data fetching and display.  A dedicated function will manage the SSE connection.

## 5. Implementation Details

* **Technology Stack:**  JavaScript (with a framework like React or Vue.js if desired) and HTML5 for the front-end, and a server technology capable of SSE (e.g., Node.js, Python with Flask or Django).
* **Data Handling:** Game data will be parsed and stored in memory, with the SSE connection constantly updating this data.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling at both the SSE connection level and when parsing/displaying the received data.


## 6. Future Enhancements

* Add user authentication and authorization.
* Implement persistent storage for user preferences.
* Offer different display options for game data.
